# ShortProject--VC-FIB
Final project of the Computer Vision Course, Barcelona Faculty of Informatics (FIB). 

In this project we analyze the robustness of the methods implemented against challenges commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, such as occlusions, scale variations, and cluttered backgrounds. We examine their ability to handle object tracking under challenging conditions and assess their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, including tracking precision and robustness. Based on our findings, we provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, offering guidelines for selecting the most appropriate technique based on the scenarios.

The methods implemented are the following.

## Tracking methods
1. SIFT based Tracker
2. Centroid based Tracker
3. Machine learning Tracker

## Object recognition methods
1. YoLo (You only Look once) recognition
2. Template matching
